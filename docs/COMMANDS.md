# Command reference

Every read command takes `--json`. Every command takes `-C <dir>` to run as if
started somewhere else.

## Exit codes

Agents branch on these, so they are a contract rather than an accident.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | success |
| 1 | unexpected error |
| 2 | usage error — bad flags or arguments |
| 3 | a gate refused the operation |
| 4 | unresolved dependencies |
| 5 | no such ticket, or an ambiguous id prefix |

`jaira next` answers "what is the single furthest-along ticket"; `jaira next
--per-lane` answers "where is work waiting", one entry per lane that has any, in
pipeline order, each carrying the lane's `agentic` flag and one ticket. The two
are different questions: under the default ordering a deep queue in a late lane
hides every earlier lane, so a step inserted mid-pipeline never sees traffic
until the queue ahead of it drains.

A lane that requires commits is normally satisfied without typing a sha: jaira
derives the list itself, as the union of the ticket file's own git history and
any commit naming the ticket's id in its message, recorded oldest-first. The
derivation runs only when the ticket records no commits of its own, and it is
written onto the ticket for good the moment the ticket leaves the board —
`jaira logbook` or `jaira archive`, whichever comes first.

Every ticket in a `--json` payload carries `next_lane`: where it goes when the
step it is in is finished, with the ticket's own Options applied and parking and
question lanes left out. Empty means there is nowhere left to go, and also
whenever the ticket is parked or waiting on an answer: such a ticket resumes
where it stopped, which the board does not record. It is a
convenience, not a rail — `jaira move` re-checks the gates whatever route the
caller took. The same payload carries `review` (`summary`, `gaps`, `verdict`,
`check`), so a reader can be handed the review without opening the board.

Under `--json`, a refusal is structured on stderr with a `code` and often a
`field`, so nothing has to be parsed out of a sentence:

```json
{"error":{"reason":"gate_refused","code":3,"violations":[
  {"code":"needs_nonmodel_signal","field":"definition-of-done",
   "message":"the definition of done is not met: criterion 2 (\"documented\") is still open…"}]}}
```

## Looking

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `jaira` | the home screen: every board, and what each needs |
| `jaira board` | open the board here directly |
| `jaira list` | list tickets; `--lane`, `--assignee`, `--tag`, `--milestone`, `--query`, `--actionable`. Each row carries `[DoD n/m]`, how much of the definition of done is settled |
| `jaira show <id>` | one ticket in full; `--notes-last <n>` keeps the newest n progress notes and says how many it hid |
| `jaira show <id> --for-lane <lane>` | the prompt and bounded input a lane's agent should get |
| `jaira next` | the next actionable ticket; `--lane`, `--assignee`, `--all`, `--per-lane` |
| `jaira tags` | the tags this board already uses: name, colour swatch, colour number and how many open tickets carry each (`--json`: `name`, `color`, `open`). **Read this before tagging** and reuse the name already there for that subject — never invent a synonym, since "ui", "frontend" and "gui" on one board are three names for one thing and filter to nothing. Writes nothing: a listing that edited the board would race every other session reading it, so a tag with no colour is shown without one |
| `jaira lanes` | the installed lanes |
| `jaira projects` | boards you have opened |
| `jaira whoami` | the identity jaira acts as, and the other names that mean you |
| `jaira sessions` | sessions working this tree |
| `jaira resume` | everything left mid-flight, with its notes |
| `jaira validate` | check every ticket for damage; `--strict` fails on warnings. Also warns when the generated agent block no longer matches this board's lanes — which happens when a lane file is edited by hand rather than through `jaira lanes` |

### Being one person under several names

A ticket belongs to its `assignee`, and the gates compare that string to who is
acting. A person is not one string: a `user.name` on one machine, a work address
in a ticket a teammate's tooling assigned, a personal address in another
repository. jaira treats git's `user.email` as you as well as `user.name`, and
reads `~/.jaira/identity` (one name per line, `#` comments allowed) for the rest.
`jaira whoami` prints the resolved list.

Names not on that list are somebody else, so their tickets are refused. That is
the point of the rail — but a rail that refuses your own tickets only teaches you
to pass `--force` to everything, which protects nothing.

### Tag colours

`tags` is a plain list field on the ticket. The colours are not: they live once
per board in `.jaira/tags`, one line per tag, so a colour is a fact about the
tag rather than about every ticket wearing it and recolouring one is a one-line
diff instead of a rewrite of every ticket.

```
# jaira tag colours — one "name: <ansi256>" line per tag.
# The number is an ANSI-256 colour, 0-255. Hand-edit it freely: jaira only ever
# adds a line for a name it has not seen yet, rewrites the one line whose colour
# you change, and never reorders or reformats the rest of this file.
# A tag with no line here is real; it just renders without a colour.
backend: 73
ui: 33
```

New entries are inserted in alphabetical position rather than appended, so two
teammates adding two tags at once do not both write the last line — the one
place their commits are guaranteed to conflict. A file whose entries are *not*
already sorted is never reordered: the new line lands after the last entry, so
hand-grouped tags stay under the comment that describes them. Comments, blank
lines and lines jaira cannot parse are kept verbatim. A new tag is given a random
colour still free in a sixteen-colour palette; past sixteen tags colours repeat,
chosen from the name itself so the repeat is at least stable across machines.

The file is written with git's own `union` driver: `.jaira/.gitattributes` gains
`/tags merge=union`, anchored so it claims the registry and not every file named
`tags` further down. A merge therefore keeps both sides rather than picking one.
Union can leave two lines for one tag when both sides recolour it; that is
harmless, because the file is read last-wins and the next write rewrites that
same last line. Writes go through a temporary file and a rename, under the same
lock the ticket store uses, so two sessions tagging at once cannot lose a tag
between them.

It travels with the board. Only `/.jaira/lanes/` is machine-scoped, so on a
shared board `.jaira/tags` is committed like the tickets are and one tag looks
the same to everybody — which is the reason it is one file per board and not a
field per ticket.

## Writing

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `jaira init` | prepare a repository; writes a jaira section into `CLAUDE.md` |
| `jaira update` | re-apply this repository's jaira setup and print what changed since the version that last did it. Regenerates the agent block, including the section describing this board's own lanes, so adopting a lane is when the note catches up with the board |
| `jaira self upgrade` | replace the running jaira binary with the latest release, verifying its checksum first; `--check` reports without installing, `--version vX.Y.Z` pins or downgrades; refuses a Homebrew or `go install` build, naming the right way to upgrade that install instead. Whether a newer release exists is checked at most once a day in the background and shown as a status line in the launcher's and the board's footer — never printed by a CLI command, which stay quiet on purpose. `JAIRA_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` turns the check off. |
| `jaira create <title>` | create a ticket; `--goal`, `--context`, `--dod`, `--assignee`, `--mine` (assign it to you now; a plain create belongs to nobody), `--lane`, `--tier`, `--tag` (repeatable; run `jaira tags` first), `--blocked-by`, `--follows` (the ticket this one follows on from; must resolve) |
| `jaira set <id> k=v…` | set frontmatter fields; list fields take a comma-separated value, `tags=ui,backend` included |
| `jaira tag <id> <name>…` | add topic tags to a ticket. Run `jaira tags` first. A name the board knows is reused and said to be; a new one gets a free colour from the palette. Names are stored lowercase-kebab — "My UI" is filed as `my-ui`, and you are told so; anything outside `[a-z0-9-]` is refused rather than trimmed down, because a quietly shortened name is a second name for one subject. `--color <0-255>` picks the colour instead, and recolours a tag that already has one; it takes exactly one name. Under `--json` the payload carries `tags_new` and `tags_reused` |
| `jaira milestone create <name> [id...]` | start a milestone — the set of tickets that belong to one round of work — as `.jaira/milestones/<name>.md`, with any tickets named put into it. The colour is picked at random from the ones no other milestone uses; `--color <1-255>` overrides it (0 is "no colour" and is refused). Names are lowercase-kebab like tags, because the name is also the filename. A name belonging to a **filed** milestone is refused (exit 3): its ref still holds it, and `jaira restore <name>.md`, run in the tree that filed it, brings that one back |
| `jaira milestone add <name> <id>…` | put tickets into a milestone — every id in one write of one file, which is the point: grouping twenty tickets is one edit, not twenty ticket files each travelling on its own ref. A ticket already in it is left where it is rather than moved to the end |
| `jaira milestone rm <name> <id>…` | take tickets out of a milestone, in one write, leaving every other line where it was. **The milestone itself stays standing**, even when its last ticket leaves: it goes away on command and never on its own, or a milestone you just created would vanish the moment you took a ticket back out. `jaira logbook <name>` is the command that takes it off the board |
| `jaira milestone ls` | this board's milestones: colour swatch, colour number and how many tickets each holds (`--json`: `milestones`, `count`, `dir`). **Read it before creating one**, for the reason `jaira tags` is read before tagging — "q4" and "quarter-four" are two names for one round of work and each filters to half of it |
| `jaira dod <id> <n> --doing\|--done\|--todo\|--superseded` | mark a checklist item; `[-]` superseded is retired, not achieved — it stops blocking completion and never reports as done |
| `jaira dod <id> <n> --text "…"` | reword one item, leaving its state and its proof alone |
| `jaira dod <id> --add "…"` | append checklist items; repeat for several |
| `jaira dod <id> --plan …` | address the Plan checklist instead of the definition of done |
| `jaira dod <id> --option <name>` | turn an optional step on for this ticket (`--todo` turns it off) |
| `jaira move <id> --to <lane>` | move lanes, applying the gates; `--what`, `--why`, `--resolves`, `--commits` (an override — the commits requirement is normally satisfied by jaira's own git-derived list; pass this only to force a specific set), `--question` (entering the human lane), `--reason` (entering the blocked lane), `--from-lane` (validate piped lane output), `--force`, `--dry-run` (run the gates and report, writing nothing — same exit code the real move would return) |
| `jaira note <id> "…"` | record progress a later session would otherwise rediscover |
| `jaira claim <id>` | take a 30-minute lease so two sessions do not collide; taking over a lease that has expired is allowed and is reported, on stderr and as `took_over` in `--json` |
| `jaira archive <id>` | take a ticket off the board (nothing is deleted); stamps derived commits first, best-effort |
| `jaira logbook [id]` | take a terminal-lane ticket off the board into `.jaira/logbook/<initials>-<yyyymmdd>/`, stamping its derived commits first; with no argument, lists what went into the logbook in the last `logbook-days` days (`~/.jaira/settings.json`, 28 when unset — the same window the board shows below its terminal lane), read off each folder's date, and says how many older entries it left out and which setting cut them — `--since` sets the window for one listing and wins over the setting (`4w`, `10d`, in weeks or days), `--since 0` and `logbook-days 0` list everything, and `--json` carries `hidden` and `since` beside `logbook` and `count`. `--since` with an id or `--all` is a usage error. Exit codes: 3 if the ticket has not reached the terminal lane, 5 for an unknown id, 2 for too many arguments |
| `jaira logbook <milestone>` | the same for a milestone named by hand — `--all` sweeps the terminal lane and never takes a group with it. The file moves into `.jaira/logbook/<initials>-<yyyymmdd>/milestones/`, `jaira milestone ls` stops naming it, no card carries its colour and the board's `M` filter forgets it. Refused (exit 3) while any ticket in it is short of the terminal lane. **Its ref is not taken down**: it stays up carrying `status: filed` — that line, not the file's whereabouts, is what keeps a milestone off a board — so a clone that already has the file gets it marked on its next `jaira fetch` and stops showing the group, and the name stays taken |
| `jaira restore <file>` | put an archived or logged ticket back, or a filed milestone — a file found under `logbook/<folder>/milestones/` goes back to `.jaira/milestones/` with its ticket list and colour intact, and its ref is unmarked in the same breath so the other clones stop hiding it. If the mark cannot be taken off, the restore fails (exit 1) instead of reporting a milestone the board cannot show |
| `jaira delete <id>` | remove a ticket's file for good; asks for the handle typed back, `--force` skips it. Refused while another ticket still points at it. Archive is almost always what you want |
| `jaira resolve <id>` | settle the fields a merge could not |
| `jaira share` | publish the board; `--undo` makes it private again |
| `jaira projects add <path>` | register a board; `--scan` searches two levels down |
| `jaira lanes use <id>` | copy a lane's catalogue or shipped version onto this board; `--force` overwrites the board's copy (how a lane is reset to the shipped one). Like `add`, `remove` and `move`, it regenerates the agent block, since changing the pipeline is when the note stops being true |
| `jaira lanes add <id>` | add a built-in or catalogue lane to this board, placed where its `after:` chain points — followed through lanes this board has not installed, so the success line names the neighbour it landed after. A board is its lane directory — the lane's file is written there, and that is what puts it on the board |
| `jaira lanes remove <id>` | remove a lane from this project's board (it stays in the catalogue); refused, naming them, if any ticket sits in it |
| `jaira lanes move <id> --left\|--right` | shift a lane one column in this project's order, swapping it with its neighbour |
| `jaira lanes publish <id>` | copy a lane into `.jaira/shared/<you>/` for teammates; `--force` |
| `jaira lanes adopt <path>` | copy a teammate's shared lane (the path `lanes shared` prints) into your catalogue; `--force` |
| `jaira lanes default` | show or set which lanes and options a new board starts with; `--lanes`, `--options`, `--clear` |
| `jaira lanes market` | list the lanes published in the jaira repository's `lanes/` directory on GitHub — id, name, description, fetched and parsed. Needs the network; says so otherwise. `JAIRA_MARKET_API` points it elsewhere (https, or loopback http for tests) and is named in the output when set |
| `jaira lanes market adopt <id>` | download a marketplace lane into your catalogue under its own id; `--force` overwrites. Then `jaira lanes add <id>` puts it on a board. Exit 2 for an unknown id, naming what exists |

## Agent plumbing

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `jaira tasks` | emit the board as a task list an agent can adopt |
| `jaira sync-tasks` | mirror an agent's task list into the backlog |
| `jaira checkpoint` | record what this session is working on |
| `jaira merge-driver` | called by git; not run by hand |
| `jaira hook print` | print a Claude Code Stop-hook snippet for `~/.claude/settings.json` that refuses to end a session while an agentic lane still has work waiting. Opt-in: nothing is installed, and the hook lets the session end when it cannot read a board |

## Keys

Board:

```
h l ← →   lane            enter   open ticket      n   new ticket
j k ↓ ↑   card            /       filter (key:value narrows to one field:
                                  id title goal context assignee lane tag body)
g G       first / last    m       move ticket      ?   help
v         compact view    x       archive          r   reload
z         hide empty lanes        q   quit
S         settings: lanes, the default board, days of logbook shown
```

The terminal lane ends with the logbook of the last `logbook-days` days
(`~/.jaira/settings.json`, 28 when unset, `0` hides them), newest first, filled
in teal and marked `⎙ filed <day>`. They are read-only: `enter` opens one, and
every key that would change it answers with the `jaira restore` line instead.
The settings screen (`S`) shows the number and edits it: `enter` on the row,
type the days, `enter` saves.

In an open ticket:

```
e   edit fields (enter newline, ctrl+s save)   a   accept (at a checkpoint)
E   edit body and checklists in $EDITOR        f   follow-up from the review
y   copy the full ticket id                    n   follow-up beside this one
b   open the ticket this one is blocked by     m   move it
jk  next / previous ticket                     tab other pane, in the split
↓↑ scroll (ctrl+d/u pages) a ticket taller than the terminal
```

`n` splits the screen: the ticket it follows on the left, the follow-up written
on the right. Nothing is written until `ctrl+s`, which creates it in the default
lane with `follows` set; `esc` discards the draft. `n` again chains from the
ticket just written. The editor keeps `tab` for its fields, so `shift+↓↑` scrolls
the left pane while you type; after saving, `tab` moves between panes. No split
below 80 columns or 20 rows.

A refused move offers `f` to override it and asks again before writing, which is
the TUI's `--force`: any refusal, reported in the output, nothing written to the
ticket.

Lane settings (`S` then lanes): the project's lanes drawn as a small board,
with a `+` column at the far right that opens the catalogue.

```
h l       select a column        x   remove the selected lane from this project
H L       move the selected      enter (on +)   catalogue: choose a lane to add
          lane one column        u   copy the selected lane into this project
tab       switch to teammates'   p   publish it to teammates
          shared lanes           n   write a new lane and open it in $EDITOR
E         edit the selected lane in $EDITOR (a built-in gets an override copy first)
                                  R   pull a drifted lane's catalogue copy in
                                  a   (shared list) adopt a teammate's lane
esc       back
```

Home screen: `enter` open · `a` add a board · `r` refresh · `q` quit.
In the picker: `a` add · `i` create a board here · `s` scan two levels · `space`
toggle a result · `enter` add what is selected.

Compact view: `a`/`d` or `←`/`→` move · `enter` open the step full width ·
`1`-`9` switch project · `v` back to the board.

In an opened step: `jk` ticket · `gG` first/last · `hl` next/previous lane
(stays in this view) · `enter` open ticket · `q`/`esc`/`v` back to the compact
view.
