// Package validate checks tickets at rest.
//
// The gates in core/gate fire when a ticket moves, which means a ticket damaged
// by a hand edit, a bad merge, or an agent writing something unexpected sits
// there looking fine until someone tries to use it — and then fails with an
// error about the move rather than about the damage. This package answers the
// separate question "is what is on disk actually coherent?".
