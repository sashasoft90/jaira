// Package move is the one place a ticket changes lanes. Four write-sites grew
// up around the board — the CLI's move, the TUI's gated and forced moves, and
// the sign-off accept — and every rule that had to run "after a move" needed
// all four found by hand; a review caught the fourth only by searching. The
// gate check, the claim-on-pull, the status write and the lane's settle now
// run here, and the callers keep what is genuinely theirs: flags, staging,
// wording, and the pending/confirm dance.
