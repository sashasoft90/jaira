// Package settings holds the few choices that belong to a person rather than
// to a board.
//
// It exists because two of them arrived with the ticket refs: which remote the
// refs go to, and whether an assignment pops up a desktop notification. Neither
// belongs in the repository — one teammate wanting to be notified says nothing
// about another, and a remote name is a property of a clone, not of the project.
//
// That last point is why the remote here is only a default. This file is read
// by every board opened on the machine, so "remote": "upstream" — right for the
// one checkout that has a fork as its origin — reached every other board too
// and took down every ref command on repositories that have no upstream at all.
// The name of a remote is a property of one clone, so that is where the answer
// for one board lives: git config jaira.remote <name>, in the clone's own
// config. Not a file in .jaira/, which would be committed and therefore wrong
// for the next person, whose clone may know the same repository by another
// name; and not a path-keyed section here, which git worktrees would split into
// several entries for one clone.
//
// RemoteFor is the only way to ask: it resolves the two against each other.
// See its comment for the order and for why a per-board name never falls back.
// RemoteSourceFor is the same ladder when the caller also has to say which step
// answered.
//
// The file is ~/.jaira/settings.json, beside projects.json, and every field has
// a working default: a missing file, an unreadable one and an empty one all mean
// "the defaults", because settings a user never opened must never be the reason
// a board does not start.

//  1. git config jaira.remote in the clone. Somebody decided this for this

//     is gone, the ref command stops and says so — see Repo.Usable. A silent
//     fallback here would be the expensive kind of wrong: in a fork, origin is
//     the fork, and quietly pushing a ticket ref there loses it exactly where
//     nobody looks.
//  2. The machine-wide "remote" in settings.json, if this repository has a
//     remote by that name. It is a default for every board, so it applies here
//     only when it is true here.
//  3. The repository's only remote, when it has exactly one. There is nothing
//     to get wrong: one remote is where anything can go. This is what makes a
//     plain single-remote checkout work without anybody configuring anything,
//     even while settings.json names a remote it has never heard of.
//  4. Otherwise the configured name is returned unchanged, so the failure is
