Claims exist so parallel sessions do not pick up the same ticket. They are leases,
not locks: a claim that is not renewed within 30 minutes is treated as abandoned,
so a crashed session never leaves work permanently unreachable and there is
nothing to unlock by hand.

Claiming is advisory. It keeps 'jaira next' from handing the same work to two
sessions; it does not prevent a deliberate move.

Taking over a claim that has expired is allowed and needs no flag, but it is
reported: whose claim it was and how long ago it was last renewed. Silence there
would let two sessions work the same ticket with nothing anywhere saying so.

--release gives a claim up: your own at any time, somebody else's only once it
has expired — that clears an abandoned claim's warning without waiting. A claim
another session is actively renewing is refused.`,
