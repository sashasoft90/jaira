Write one when you learn something a later session would otherwise have to
rediscover: what you tried, what did not work, what you were about to do next.
A session that stops abruptly — a limit, a crash, a closed laptop — leaves
nothing behind except what was written down, and the point of this board is that
the work does not have to be reconstructed from memory.

Three parts, in order: what you were doing, what you found — especially what
did not work, the part everyone skips — and what the next step is. Skip the
third and the reader has to re-derive a decision you already made.

Write it as if the reader has mild ADHD and knows none of what you know — what
you were doing first, short concrete lines with one point each, names and paths
rather than adjectives, no jargon and no preamble.`,
