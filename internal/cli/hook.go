// stopHookSnippet is the settings.json fragment 'jaira hook print' emits.
//
// Everything about the shell command is deliberate:
//
//   - It checks "stop_hook_active" first and gets out of the way when it is
//     set. Claude Code sets that field on the payload once a stop hook has
//     already blocked once, and a hook that keeps blocking on a condition it
//     cannot itself resolve wedges the session. Reading it with grep costs the
//     one read of stdin the hook needs anyway.
//   - It parses nothing. jq is not installed everywhere (it is not on the
//     machine this was written on) and a hook that depends on it fails on the
//     first teammate who lacks it. The two matches it needs are single fields
//     with fixed names, and '": *true' covers both the indented and the
//     compact encoding of the same JSON.
//   - Every failure exits 0. No board, no jaira on PATH, a broken repo — the
//     stderr redirect swallows it, the grep finds nothing, and the session ends
//     normally. This copies hooks/sync-tasks.sh: a board that cannot be read is
//     a nuisance, a hook that traps someone in a session is much worse.
//   - It exits 2, not 1. Exit 2 is the only code Claude Code treats as
//     blocking; 1 is a non-blocking error that lets the stop through. The
//     stderr line is what Claude is handed as the reason to keep going, so it
//     names the command that answers "which lane".
//
// It reports on any agentic lane with waiting work, not only the ticket the
// session was last touching, because the lane nobody drives is the one that
// fills up — which is what this exists to stop.

Once installed, a session cannot end while 'jaira next --per-lane' reports an
agentic lane with work waiting. Claude is handed the reason and carries on
working that lane instead of stopping.

The hook stays out of the way when it cannot do its job: no board, no jaira on
PATH, or an already-blocked stop and it lets the session end. It never blocks
twice for the same stop, so it cannot trap you in a session.

That last guard reads the hook payload on stdin and has no other source: run
the command with stdin closed or pointed at /dev/null and it blocks every time,
unconditionally. It is a guard, not defence in depth — keep the payload on
stdin if you adapt the snippet.

This is opt-in and Claude Code specific, which is why it is a snippet you paste
rather than something 'jaira init' arranges for you.`,

// on move and claim, which is the board reaching the user.

jaira calls the script on every move and every claim, handing it the ticket in
JAIRA_EVENT, JAIRA_TICKET, JAIRA_TITLE, JAIRA_STATUS, JAIRA_ASSIGNEE,
JAIRA_ACTOR and JAIRA_ROOT, and kills it after five seconds.

As printed it rings the terminal bell, twice for a lane that belongs to a person
and once for a finished ticket, and stays silent for everything else — because a
sound is only worth the state in which nothing moves without you. It needs
nothing installed, so it runs on any machine as it stands. The script says which
lines to replace to deliver through ntfy.sh, notify-send or anything else.`,
