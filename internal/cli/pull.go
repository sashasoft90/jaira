		Short: "Take a ticket that lives on its ref and start working it here",
		Long: `Takes a ticket over on its ref and writes it here as a file.

A captured ticket belongs to nobody. Pulling it is what makes it yours: this
records you as its assignee on the ref, and only then puts the file in
.jaira/tickets/ — in that order, so that losing the race leaves you with no
file rather than with a ticket somebody else is working.

Two things can refuse it, and they mean different things:

  taken     somebody else already pulled it; the message names them, and
            --steal takes it anyway
  race      two clones pulled in the same instant and the other one landed
            first; re-read and decide

Pulling a ticket you already have is a successful no-op, so this is safe to
repeat.

This is the one command that needs the network. That is not an exception to
working offline but a consequence of it: with no route to the remote there is
no ref to read, so there is nothing to take over.`,
