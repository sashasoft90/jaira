		Use:   "snapshot",
		Short: "Write the board to its snapshot branch, and clear the refs of landed tickets",
		Long: `Writes every ticket that is on a ref into the snapshot branch, then removes the
refs of tickets that have arrived in a landing branch.

The snapshot is a backup, not the storage. The working state is always on the
refs, and every participant's clone holds the ones it has fetched, so the board
survives any one machine; this branch is for whoever clones for the first time
and has no refs at all. It is written with git plumbing and never checked out,
so a run cannot disturb whatever you are in the middle of.

The files go under board/, not .jaira/tickets/ — at the same path, merging this
branch by accident would collide with every working ticket at once.

Removing a ref happens here and nowhere else, immediately after the write: at
that moment the ticket is in the snapshot and in the branch it landed in, so
there is nothing left to lose. A ticket counts as landed only when it is filed
away — in the logbook or the archive — in one of the landing branches from
~/.jaira/settings.json ("landing-branches", globs allowed). With no landing
branch resolvable, nothing is removed at all: a ref left standing costs
nothing, one removed by mistake takes away the visibility this exists for.

Normally nobody runs this: it happens in the background when the last snapshot
is older than three days.`,
