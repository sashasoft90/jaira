// its commits stamped down, into a dated folder that records who finished
// what on which day. It was called 'jaira sync' before it was
// released: that name implied a server this tool does not have, and collided
// with 'jaira sync-tasks' (sync.go), which mirrors an agent's task list into
// the backlog and is unrelated.

		Use:   "logbook [id]",
		Short: "Take finished tickets off the board with their commits stamped down, or list the logbook",
		Long: `Moves a terminal-lane ticket into .jaira/logbook/<initials>-<yyyymmdd>/, after
stamping it with every commit git can find for it. With no argument, lists
what went into the logbook in the last logbook-days days (~/.jaira/settings.json,
28 when unset; the board shows the same window under its terminal lane) — what
recently left the board, not the whole history. --since sets the window for one
listing in weeks or days (4w, 10d) and wins over the setting; --since 0, like
logbook-days 0, lists everything. The listing says how many older entries it
left out. The date is the one in each folder's name.

--all files everything that has reached the terminal lane into today's folder,
which is the usual way: finished tickets pile up there, and whoever enters
their hours cuts them in one go.

Filing is a decision, and nothing does it for you. Reaching a terminal lane
says the work is accepted; it says nothing about whether anybody is ready to
account for it, which happens days later and covers a set somebody assembles.
A board that filed on its own once swept forty-nine other people's tickets
into a commit named after a single handle.

The folder is the record: who finished what, on which day. Leaving the board
is the moment every commit is finally known, so it is stamped here rather
than left to whoever remembers to run 'jaira set'. 'jaira restore <file>'
brings a logged ticket back, the same as an archived one.

Naming a milestone instead of a ticket files the milestone: its file moves
into .jaira/logbook/<initials>-<yyyymmdd>/milestones/, 'jaira milestone ls'
stops naming it, no card carries its colour and the board's M filter forgets
it. Its ref stays up carrying the status "filed": that line is what keeps a
milestone off a board, so a clone that already has the file has it marked on
the next fetch and stops showing the group, and the name stays taken until
somebody restores it. Only a milestone you name by hand — --all sweeps
the terminal lane and never takes a group with it. A milestone is filed only
once every ticket in it has reached the terminal lane or left the board.

'jaira archive' is for a ticket that is not being worked — abandoned,
duplicate, obsolete — and works from any lane. This command is for finished
work and refuses a ticket that has not reached the terminal lane.`,
