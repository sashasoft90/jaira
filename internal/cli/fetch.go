This is how a ticket assigned to you arrives without anyone sharing a branch:
the ref carries the whole ticket file, so it is readable with no checkout and
nothing to merge. Refs are outside refs/heads, so the default refspec does not
carry them and a teammate who does not use jaira sees none of this.

notifications are turned off in ~/.jaira/settings.json ("notify-off": true).`,
